title: Suitor roadmap
---

<span class="suitor">suitor</span> is a labour of love. That said, I've got a lot of love to give, so it's being actively developed. I work on it a little bit each day, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to see a public beta release at some point in early 2015. 

We're currently in private-alpha. Basic site functionality is in place, but there may be a few kinks here and there as we progress. That said, the code is pretty stable, and your data is safe--so it's totally usable! We're looking for some good beta testers, so if you'd like to try it out (and tell us everything that's wrong with it!) you can <a href="/launch/#signup">sign up for an invitation here</a>.

### What's in store

You can see what we're planning for <span class="suitor">suitor</span> by taking a peek at <a href="https://github.com/sarahsemark/suitor/issues">the issues on GitHub</a>. Here are some of the major functionalities we'd like to include:

- email notifications
- Google Calendar integration
- LinkedIn integration
- sending emails directly via the app
- auto-capturing posting information from the URL

And of course, I'll be redesigning everything a million times or so until I get the visuals design and the UI just right. (Designers are notoriously picky creatures.)

If there are particular features or functionality you'd like to see, let us know in the comments below!
