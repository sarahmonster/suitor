# suitor [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sarahsemark/suitor.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sarahsemark/suitor)

suitor is a Rails 4.1 web application for tracking your job applications. It
allows you to track what jobs you've applied for, when you did it, what your
cover letter was, and encourages you to follow-up and track the entire
application process.

# Installation / Setup

suitor is a Rails app (built with Rails 4.1 and developed mostly on OS X using
Ruby 2.1), so you'll need to have [Ruby][] installed. After that, run:

```bash
gem install bundler rails
```

To get bundler and rails installed. After that, check out suitor and install
its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarahsemark/suitor.git
cd suitor
bundle install
```

Now you're ready to start hacking on suitor! Instead of running migrations
one-by-one when you start developing, you're better off running `rake db:setup`
This will install the admin user for you as well as run all the initial
migrations. You can use a custom email for the admin user by specifying an
environment variable:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword rake db:setup
```

Finally, to run the rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

Now your development version of suitor is available at [localhost][].

[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/
[Ruby]: http://www.ruby-lang.org/

# Email configuration

When in production mode, any emails generated by the system will be output to the Rails console. If you need to test mail delivery and/or output more vigorously, you can also use MailCatcher or Mandrill to test delivery. (Note that emails will still be output to the Rails console even when using one of these delivery methods, so you'll always be able to test there. )

## MailCatcher

I recommend installing the [MailCatcher gem](http://mailcatcher.me) for the most straightforward test environment. To avoid conflicts, the gem isn't included in this repo's Gemfile, so you'll need to install it to your machine.

Run `gem install mailcatcher` to install the gem to your machine. To start using MailCatcher, run `mailcatcher` and add `MAILCATCHER=true` to your .env file, and you're good to go!

Open up a browser tab to [http://localhost:1080/](http://localhost:1080/). All mails sent by Rails will turn up there. Magic!

## Mandrill

Mandrill is used to deliver mails in production, so you can use it to replicate that environment as closely as possible. You'll need access to a Mandrill account--they're free for under 12,000 emails a month, and you can set up a test API key that doesn't count against your monthly quota (but won't deliver the email directly).

Once you have an account set up, just add the following lines to your .env file:

```
MANDRILL_USERNAME={YOUR-EMAIL}
MANDRILL_PASSWORD={YOUR-API-KEY}
```

Make sure that `MAILCATCHER` is set to false (or anything other than true, really) as Rails will default to using MailCatcher before Mandrill.

After changing environment variables, make sure to **restart your Rails server** so that changes are applied!
